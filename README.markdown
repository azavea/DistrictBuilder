[Azavea](http://www.azavea.com) developed the [DistrictBuilder](http://www.districtbuilder.org) software in collaboration with the [PublicMapping Project](http://www.publicmapping.org/), under the direction of Dr. Michael McDonald and Dr. Micah Altman.

The DistrictBuilder code is hosted under the PublicMapping Project's [organization account](https://github.com/PublicMapping/). That repository is named [PublicMapping/DistrictBuilder](https://github.com/PublicMapping/DistrictBuilder).
