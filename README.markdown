# DistrictBuilder

[Azavea](http://www.azavea.com) developed the DistrictBuilder software in collaboration with the PublicMapping Project, under the direction of Dr. Michael McDonald and Dr. Micah Altman.

The DistrictBuilder code is hosted under the [PublicMapping Project](http://www.publicmapping.org/)'s organization account. That repository is named [PublicMapping/DistrictBuilder](https://github.com/PublicMapping/DistrictBuilder).
